            <p className=" mr-6 font-semibold">  Our primary objective is to offer assistance to
          women in need by providing them with financial support. This support
          goes towards helping them overcome financial hurdles that often
          obstruct their path towards empowerment. Additionally, we organize
          seminars and conferences to raise awareness about women's rights.
          These events are designed to educate the public and foster a more
          inclusive and just society in Pakistan.</p>
